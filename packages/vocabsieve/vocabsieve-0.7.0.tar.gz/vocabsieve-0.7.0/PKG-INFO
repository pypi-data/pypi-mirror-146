VocabSieve (formerly Simple Sentence Mining, `ssmtool`) is a program for sentence mining, in which sentences with target vocabulary words are collected and added into a spaced repetition system (SRS) for language learning.

## Features
- Double-click lookups from sentences and even faster lookups from integrated applications
- Lemmatization of words on lookup
- No internet is required if you use downloaded resources
- Online and local dictionaries in multiple formats
- Frequency lists and pronunciations
- Web reader (epub, fb2, plaintext) allowing one-click lookup
- Kindle highlights to Anki sentence cards (KOReader support is planned too)

For a detailed list of features and language support data, please consult the [blog post](https://freelanguagetools.org/2021/07/simple-sentence-mining-ssmtool-full-tutorial/) on my blog

**USERS**: If you want to install it, go to [Releases](https://github.com/FreeLanguageTools/vocabsieve/releases/) and from the latest release, download the appropriate file for your operating system. 

## Linux distro packages
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/ssmtool.svg)](https://repology.org/project/ssmtool/versions)

## Development
To run from source, simply use `pip3 -r requirements.txt` and then `python3 vocabsieve.py`.

Alternatively, you can also install a live version to your python package library with `pip3 install .` (Add --user if there is a permission error)

For debugging purposes, set the environmental variable `VOCABSIEVE_DEBUG` to any value. This will create a separate profile (settings and databases for records and dictionaries) so you may perform tests without affecting your normal profile. For each different value of `VOCABSIEVE_DEBUG`, a separate profile is generated. This can be any number or string.

Note that VocabSieve is unable to delete old profiles. You must do so yourself based on your operating system's locations.  

## API documentation
If you want to leverage VocabSieve to build your own plugins/apps, you can refer to the [API Documentation](API.md)

Note that VocabSieve is still alpha software. API is not guaranteed to be stable at this point.
