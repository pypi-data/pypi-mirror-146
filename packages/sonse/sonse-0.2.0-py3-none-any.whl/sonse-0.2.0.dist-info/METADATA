Sonse
=====

**Sonse** (*Stephen's Obsessive Note-Storage Engine*, pronounced *sonÂ·see*) is a command-line note management application. It allows you to create, edit and maintain your plaintext notes while keeping them archived in a single human-readable zip file.

If you've got a bunch of loose text files lying around and you'd like to keep them organised, Sonse is for you. It'll keep them safe, sorted and sensible, forever.

> **Note:** Sonse is designed primarily for Linux and Linux-based operating systems; in particular it uses several Linux defaults and environment variables for its basic functions. Mac OS should work (please tell me if it doesn't), but Windows is unsupported at this time.

Installation
------------

Sonse requires [Python 3.10][p310] and a few dependencies. You can install it one of two ways:

### PyPi Package

You can get the official [PyPi package][pypi] with pip:

```text
$ pip install sonse
$ sonse --help
```

This will install Sonse with a `sonse` executable you can run directly. Nice and easy.

### Source Code

You can also clone the [Mercurial repository][repo] and run the source code yourself, if you're interesting in tinkering with the code:

```text
$ hg clone https://hg.sr.ht/~rattlerake/sonse
$ cd sonse
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m sonse --help
```

You'll need to install [the dependencies][reqs] and run Sonse from the Python module, or create an alias for it.

Setup
-----

### Archives

Sonse stores notes at `$HOME/.config/sonse/sonse.zip`. If it can't find a valid archive, it will create one at that location.

The archive is a single standard zip file containing notes ending in `.txt`. Each file is formatted in UTF-8 and has a lowercase name, like this:

```sh
sonse.zip/
- alpha.txt    # Name: "alpha"
- bravo.txt    # Name: "bravo"
- test-123.txt # Name: "test-123"
```

These names are used in commands and are always rendered as lowercase without punctuation, excluding hyphens and underscores. If you try to create a note called `FOO_BAR`, Sonse will interpret it as `foo_bar`.

### Shell Completion

Sonse uses [Click][clck] for its interface, which has optional support for shell auto-completions. I highly recommend [enabling this functionality][comp] if you have a shell that supports it. (Sonse will work fine without it, but it's nice to have.)

Commands
--------

### `create NAME`

Create a new note in your archive.

- `-e --edit`: Edit the note after creation.

```sh
$ sonse create alpha
# Creates "alpha.txt" as an empty file in your archive.

$ sonse create bravo --edit
# Creates "bravo.txt" and opens it in your default text editor.
```

### `delete NAME`

Delete an existing note from your archive.

- `-f --force`: Bypass the "are you sure?" prompt.

```sh
$ sonse delete alpha
Are you sure you want to delete 'alpha'? [y/N]: y
# Deletes "alpha.txt" from your archive.

$ sonse delete bravo --force
# Deletes "bravo.txt" without prompt.
```

### `edit NAME`

Open an existing note in your default text editor.

```sh
$ sonse edit alpha
# Opens "alpha.txt" in your default text editor.
```

### `export NAME FILE`

Copy an existing note to a file on-disk.

```text
$ sonse export alpha ~/some-file.txt
$ cat ~/some-file.txt
This is an example note.
```

### `import NAME FILE`

Copy a file on-disk to a new or existing note.

```text
$ sonse import alpha ~/some-file.txt
$ sonse read alpha
This is an example note.
```

### `list GLOB`

Print a list of all existing notes, or notes matching a [glob pattern][glob].

- `-r --reverse`: Reverse sorting order.
- `-s --sort`: Sort by `name` or `size`.

```text
$ sonse list
alpha
bravo
charlie

$ sonse list a*
alpha

$ sonse list --sort=name --reverse
charlie
bravo
alpha
```

### `move ORIG DEST`

Rename an existing note to a new name.

```sh
$ sonse move alpha bravo
# Renames "alpha.txt" to "delta.txt" in your archive.
```

### `read NAME`

Print the contents of an existing note.

```text
$ sonse read alpha
This is an example note.
```
