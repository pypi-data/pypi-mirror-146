Sonse
=====

**Sonse** (*Stephen's Obsessive Note-Storage Engine*, pronounced *sonÂ·see*) is a command-line note management application. It allows you to create, edit and maintain your plaintext notes while keeping them archived in a single human-readable zip file.

If you've got a bunch of loose text files lying around and you'd like to keep them organised, Sonse is for you. It'll keep them safe, sorted and sensible, forever.

> **Note:** Sonse is designed primarily for Linux and Linux-based operating systems; in particular it uses several Linux defaults and environment variables for its basic functions. Mac OS should work (please tell me if it doesn't), but Windows is unsupported at this time.

Installation
------------

Sonse requires [Python 3.10][p310] and only depends on [click][clck] (and [py.test][pyte] for testing).

To install, either:

1. Get the official [PyPi package][pypi] with `pip install sonse`, or
2. Clone the [Mercurial repository][repo] and run `python -m sonse`.

Configuration
-------------

Sonse stores notes in `$HOME/.config/sonse/sonse.zip`. If it can't find a valid archive, it will create one at that location. If you have a large number of notes ready to go, you can then open this archive and add your files.

The archive is a single standard zip file containing notes ending in `.txt`. Each file is formatted in UTF-8 and has a lowercase name, like this:

```sh
sonse.zip/
- alpha.txt    # Name: "alpha"
- bravo.txt    # Name: "bravo"
- test-123.txt # Name: "test-123"
```

These names are used in commands and are always rendered as lowercase without punctuation, excluding hyphens and underscores. If you try to create a note called `FOO_BAR`, Sonse will interpret it as `foo_bar`.

Commands
--------

### `create NAME`

Create a new note in your archive.

```sh
$ sonse create alpha
# Creates "alpha.txt" as an empty file in your archive.
```

### `edit NAME`

Open an existing note in your default text editor.

```sh
$ sonse edit alpha
# Opens "alpha.txt" in your default text editor.
```

### `export NAME FILE`

Copy an existing note to a file on-disk.

```text
$ sonse export alpha ~/some-file.txt
$ cat ~/some-file.txt
This is an example note.
```

### `import NAME FILE`

Copy a file on-disk to a new or existing note.

```text
$ sonse import alpha ~/some-file.txt
$ sonse read alpha
This is an example note.
```

### `list GLOB`

Print a list of existing notes matching a [glob pattern][glob]. By default this is the wildcard `*`, which matches all notes.

```text
$ sonse list
alpha
bravo
charlie

$ sonse list a*
alpha
```

### `read NAME`

Print the contents of an existing note.

```text
$ sonse read alpha
This is an example note.
```
