Pupil Invisible LSL Relay
*************************

The Pupil Invisible LSL Relay (Relay) allows you to stream gaze and event data from your
Pupil Invisible device to the `labstreaminglayer <https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer>`_ (LSL).

Install and Usage
==================

Install the Pupil Invisible Relay with pip::

   pip install pupil-invisible-lsl-relay

After you installed the relay, you can start it by executing::

   pupil_invisible_lsl_relay

The Relay takes two optional arguments:

- ``--time_sync_interval`` is used to set the interval (in seconds) at which the relay sends events
  to the Pupil Invisible device that can be used for time synchronization. The default is 60 seconds.

- ``--timeout`` is used to define the maximum time (in seconds) the relay will search the network for new
  devices before returning. The default is 10 seconds.

.. caution::
   The Relay currently relies on `NTP`_ for time synchronization between the phone and
   the computer running the relay application. See the :ref:`timestamp_docs` section for
   details.
