        .. WARNING::
            As Landsat 7 is broken (with nodata stripes all over the bands),
            the footprint is not easily computed and may take some time to be delivered.

        Overload of the generic function because landsat nodata seems to be different in QA than in regular bands.
        Indeed, nodata pixels vary according to the band sensor footprint,
        whereas QA nodata is where at least one band has nodata.

        We chose to keep QA nodata values for the footprint in order to show where all bands are valid.

        **TL;DR: We use the QA nodata value to determine the product's footprint**.
