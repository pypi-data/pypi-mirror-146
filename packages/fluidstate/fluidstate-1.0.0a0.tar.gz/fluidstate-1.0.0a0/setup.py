These params can be method names (as strings),\ncallables, or lists of method names or callables.\n\n\nTransitions\n-----------\n\nTransitions lead the machine from a state to another. Transitions must have\n*source*, *target*, and *event* parameters. *source* is one or more (as list) states\nfrom which the transition can be beforeed. *target* is the state to which the\ntransition will lead the machine. *event* is the method that have to be called\nto launch the transition. This method is automatically created by the Fluidity\nengine.\n\nA transition can have optional *trigger* and *need* parameters. *trigger* is a\nmethod (or callable) that will be called when transition is launched. If\nparameters are passed to the event method, they are passed to the *trigger*\nmethod, if it accepts these parameters. *need* is a method (or callable) that\nis called to allow or deny the transition, depending on the result of its\nexecution. Both "trigger" and *need* can be lists.\n\nThe same event can be in multiple transitions, going to different states, having\ntheir respective needs as selectors. For the transitions having the same event,\nonly one need should return a true value at a time.\n\n\nIndividuation\n-------------\n\nStates and transitions are defined in a class-wide mode. However, one can define\nstates and transitions for individual objects. For example, having "door" as a\nstate machine::\n\n    door.add_state(\'broken\')\n    door.add_transition(event=\'crack\', source=\'closed\', target=\'broken\')\n\n\nThese additions only affect the target object.\n\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n\nJust run::\n\n    pip install fluidstate\n\n\nHow to run tests\n----------------\n\nJust run::\n\n    tox\n\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThis is forked from: https://github.com/nsi-iff/fluidity\nOriginal author is: Rodrigo ManhÃ£es\n',
