        These implementations are mostly based on
        
        * Christer Ericson: Real-Time Collision Detection, CRC Press, 2004.
        * David H. Eberly: 3D Game Engine Design, CRC Press, 2006.
        
        and accompanying implementations. These are marked as such.
        
        The GJK algorithm is a translation to Python of the translation to C of the
        original Fortran implementation. The C implementation is from Diego Ruspini.
        It is available from http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/files/gilbert.c
        
        Some features related to the GJK algorithm have been inspired by
        [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/) (zlib license) and are
        marked as such in the source code.
        
        The EPA algorithm is adapted from
        [Kevin Moran's GJK implementation](https://github.com/kevinmoran/GJK)
        (MIT License or Unlicense).
        
        The translation to Python has been done by Alexander Fabisch and the glue
