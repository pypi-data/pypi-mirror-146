We often need to simplify the official bib that consists of many information into a shorter version that only maintains necessary information (e.g., author, title, conference/journal name and etc) due to page limitation.

We introduce __SimBiber__, a simple tool in Python to simplify them automatically. Hope it's helpful for you.

We also highly recommend another wonderful tool for you [Rebiber](https://github.com/yuchenlin/rebiber), which is a tool for normalizing bibtex with official info.

**Tips**:If you use Rebiber and then Simbiber can get a better experience.

  <p style="padding: 0 20px 0 20px;color: #444444;letter-spacing: 1.15px;">
    SimBiber is a fairly new project and it is under active development. 
    We hope that it will be quite useful in a variety of cases, but there is no guarantee that the results it produces will necessarily be strictly compliant with the official specification.

## Installation

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/MLNLP-World/Simbiber.git
cd Simbiber/
pip install -e .
```
OR
```bash  
pip install simbiber
```

If you would like to use the latest github version with more bug fixes, please use the first installation method.

## Usage(v0.7.0)

```bash 
simbiber -i [input bib path] -o [output bib path]
```
Tips: All path args support absolute and relative paths

| simplified | argument | usage|
|------ | ----------- | ----------- |
|`-i`| `--input_path` | The path to the input bib `file` or `directory` that you want to simplify. |
|`-o`| `--output_path` | <span style="color:#b0b0b0;font-size:10px;">[Optional]</span> The path to the output bib file that you want to save. <br/> <b>PLEASE ATTENTION:</b> <ul><li>It only works in simplify single bib file.</li><ul><li>If `output_path==input_path`, it will rewrite input file.</li></ul> <li>Without this param, it will be auto filled:<ul><li>If simplifying single bib `file`, it will rewrite input file;</li> <li>If simplifying bib `directory`, it will output to `./out` dir.</li></ul></li></ul>   |
|`-c`| `--config_path` | <span style="color:#b0b0b0;font-size:10px;">[Optional]</span>The path to the mapper config file. The path can be a file directory path, like `config` or a single file path, like `config.json`. <br/> <b>PLEASE ATTENTION:</b> If you want to simplify a huge bib file, you'd better extract external `json` config file to achieve satisfactory speed. |
|`-a`| `--if_append_output` | <span style="color:#b0b0b0;font-size:10px;">[Optional]</span> Whether append simplified data to output bib file. |
|`-r`| `--remove_duplicate` | <span style="color:#b0b0b0;font-size:10px;">[Optional]</span> Whether remove duplication if your bib has both of arXiv or Conference citation.<br/> <b>PLEASE ATTENTION:</b> If `True`, it might cost more time to write simplified bib file. Please keep patient.  |
|`-cch`| `--cache_num` | <span style="color:#b0b0b0;font-size:10px;">[Optional]</span>The number of bib items you want to simplify at once.<br/> <b>PLEASE ATTENTION:</b> If you want to simplify a huge bib file, you'd better change it to achieve satisfactory speed. |


## Example Input and Output
An example simplified output entry with the official information (The forms of bibitem like `xxx="..."` or `xxx={...}` are both supported):
```bib

    author = "Li, Bai  and
     Ha, Pi  and
     Jin, Shibai  and
     Xue, Hua  and
     Mao, Tai",
    booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)",
    month = nov,
    year = "2019",
    address = "Hong Kong, China",
    publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics",
    url = "https://aclanthology.org/D19-1214",
    doi = "10.18653/v1/D19-1214",
    pages = "2078--2087",
    abstract = "Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks for building a spoken language understanding (SLU) system. The two tasks are closely tied and the slots often highly depend on the intent. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SLU to better incorporate the intent information, which further guiding the slot filling. In our framework, we adopt a joint model with Stack-Propagation which can directly use the intent information as input for slot filling, thus to capture the intent semantic knowledge. In addition, to further alleviate the error propagation, we perform the token-level intent detection for the Stack-Propagation framework. Experiments on two publicly datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other previous methods by a large margin. Finally, we use the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) model in our framework, which further boost our performance in SLU task.",

## Adding a new conference

You can manually add any conferences from DBLP to config map.

Take ICLR as an example:

- Step 1: Go to [DBLP](https://dblp.org/db/conf/iclr/iclr2020.html) 
- Step 2: Find the full name of Conference
- Step 3: Add map to ```config/ML.json``` or ```parserConfig.json```(You should specify the config path)
```json
{"International Conference on Learning Representations": "ICLR"}
```
