Description: # Garden
        
        A software manager for easy **development** and **distribution** of **Python code**.
        
        The main features that Garden adds to Python are:
        
        - Support for large-scale, **multi-package projects**
        - **Reproducibility** (clear, transparent **dependency management**)
        - Robust **development-lifecycle**, from blueprinting to distribution 
        
        Garden is inspired by what **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)** is for Java and uses [Pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
        
        ## Why Garden
        
        **Python is great** in many things, particularly for **scripting**. But it is powerful enough to create **complex software** too. Still, when doing so, it lacks some robustness and quickness.
        
        Instead:
         
        - Garden lets you **forget about repetitive setup of Python projects**, with creation of Virtual Environments, issues with imports, PYTHONPATH, folder structures. It does all of this for you.
        
        - Garden ensures that when you run a Python script, all its **requirements are implicitly installed**. Along with reproducibility, this makes room for **easy collaboration** between developers.
        
        - Also, while with standard tools it's hard to have multiple packages, one requiring the other, with Garden is a matter of **few YAML files**. You can **split your project** in several packages instead of having tons of requirements, code replication and/or single package-monoliths. 
        
        All in all, Garden lets you design **proper structure and modularity** for your code. No worries about imports and low-level stuff.
