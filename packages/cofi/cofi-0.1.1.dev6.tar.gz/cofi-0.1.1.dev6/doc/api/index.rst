APIs for Basic Usage
--------------------

`BaseProblem` is the base class of all forward problems. It includes methods you
can use so as to define a forward problem.

`InversionOptions` is a holder for you to define how you'd like the inversion problem
to be solved.

With instances of `BaseProblem` and `InversionOptions` defined, they are passed InversionOptions
an `InversionRunner` and an inversion run gives a result object of the type `InversionResult`.
