# BAIT_

**It**erative **Ba**er picking system.

----------

The BaIt picking system is a software created around the already famous and widely used Baer-Kradolfer picker (Baer 1987). The proposed seismic picker push forward the already great performance of the Baer-Kradolfer algorithm by adding an iterative picking procedure over the given seismic trace.

It relies on standard libraries like numpy, matplotlib and ObsPy. For the installation, see further.

## Installation
The file `./data/bait_condaenv.ylm` contains all the encessary dependencies to install and run the framework. The lines to be typed in the terminal are

```bash
$ conda create -n bait python=3.6
$ conda activate bait
$ pip install .
$ pytest # to check everything is cool :)
```

Prior of the run of the subsequent code, the user must have installed `conda` or `miniconda` ([HOW-TO](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)).
