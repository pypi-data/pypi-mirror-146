## About

Shades is a python module for generative 2d image creation.

The main abstract object is a 'shade' which will determine color based on rules, and contains methods for drawing on images.

The majority of these implement simplex noise fields to determine color resulting in images that will appear different each time they are generated.

Current existing shades are:

* BlockColor
* HorizontalGradient
* VerticalGradient
* PointGradients
* NoiseGradient
* DomainWarpGradient
* SwirlOfShades

All shades have inherit internal methods that can be used for drawing on images.

Current existing methods are:

* rectangle
* triangle
* shape
* circle
* pizza_slice
* fill

## Installing Shades

Shades is pip installable with *python -m pip install shades*

## Using Shades

Shades is designed to help make image creation easier.
There are three types of objects that get used, they are:
  - Canvas
  - NoiseField
  - Shade

### Canvas

The *Canvas* object is just a wrapper for a PIL image object.
The idea is that you don't have to import two libraries all the time, but if you'd prefer, you can switch out the *Canvas* call for a PIL image one. This is useful to know as well if you'd like to work between the two modules, or import images/photos to draw on or use with **Shades**.

Here's a simple example using just the *Canvas* object:
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas(width=100, height=100, color=(200, 0, 0))

canvas.save('exciting_red_square.png')
canvas.show()
```

This script will save, and bring up the following image:
![Red square](https://github.com/benrutter/Shades/blob/main/images/red_canvas.png)

Not too exciting, right? We created a monotone red image that is 100 by 100 pixels. Color is worth taking note, as throughout **Shades** colors are treated and expected to be tuples of the Red, Green and Blue color values (on a scale of 0 to 255). So (200, 0, 0) gives us a red tone.

There's not much else you can do with *Canvas*, the idea is just to give us an image *on which we can draw stuff*.

If you call **Canvas()** without any arguments, you'll get a light grey canvas of 700 x 700 pixels.


### NoiseField

*NoiseField* is a pretty handy concept here. A lot of the time with images, we might want an element of randomness, but with a gentler transition. *NoiseField* is the answer to this, as it gives us random gradients between numbers.

Here's an example of a simple *NoiseField* use:

```python
import shades

noise_field = shades.NoiseField(scale=0.002, seed=8)
random_number = noise_field.noise((24, 100))
```

In this, *random_number* is the return of the 'noise' call, which takes in coordinates (in the form of an (x, y) tuple) and spits out a float between 0 and 1. The important thing about *NoiseField* vs purely random number generation, is that if we get the return of a nearby point, say (25, 101), then the float between 0 and 1 will be close to our first call. The further away from the point we get, the further away the noise value is likely to be.

When creating a *NoiseField*, the two arguments we can put in are *scale* (which affected how quickly generated numbers will change between points, and 'seed' which is used for generating the semi-random numbers)

**Shades** uses a really cool module called OpenSimplex to do this. If you're interested in finding out more about noise in general, search for *Perlin Noise* and *Simplex Noise* - there really interesting fields, and used a lot in texture generation.


### Shade

The *Shade* object as you'd guess in a module called **Shades** does pretty much all the work. You can think of them as like code-pencils - they have properties that affect what color stuff will be, and a bunch of methods to let us draw stuff.

Here's a simple example using a *BlockColor* shade, that'll always produce the same color:
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas(200, 200)
cyan = shades.BlockColor((0, 255, 255))
cyan.rectangle(canvas, (50, 50), width=100, height=150)

canvas.show()
```

This script does a few things:
- Creates a *Canvas* to draw on
- Creates a *BlockColor* shade to draw with
- Draws a rectangle with the *BlockColor* object on coordinates (50, 50) of the *Canvas*
- Displays the canvas

This is what the picture will look like:
![A cyan rectangle](https://github.com/benrutter/Shades/blob/main/images/cyan_rectangle.png)

A lot of *Shade* objects use *NoiseField*, for example, the *NoiseGradient* object which chooses color based on noise responses to (x,y) coordinates. Which we can see here:
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas(200, 200)
gradient = shades.NoiseGradient(
  color=(200, 200, 200),
  noise_fields=[shades.NoiseField(scale=0.02) for i in range(3)]
)
gradient.circle(
  canvas,
  (canvas.width/2, canvas.height/2),
  radius=50,
)

canvas.show()
```
(There are three *NoiseField* objects taken by the *noise_field* parameter, one for red, green and blue, using the same *NoiseField* would create a gradient that changes how light/dark the color is without affecting the overall tone)
![A gradient circle](https://github.com/benrutter/Shades/blob/main/images/gradient_circle.png)

Also, all *Shade* objects can be called with 'warp_noise' that will use noise to affect the location of points:
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas(200, 200)

warped_shade = shades.BlockColor(
  color=(100, 200, 100),
  warp_size=50,
  warp_noise=[shades.NoiseField(scale=0.01) for i in range(3)]
)

warped_shade.line(canvas,(0, 0), (canvas.width, canvas.height))

canvas.show()
```
(the line's location is affected by the two *NoiseField* relating to x and y warping, giving us a wavy green line)

### Hacking Shades

One of the goals of the *Shade* object, is to make something that's easily extensible. You can create your own *Shade* and already have access to the drawing methods and location warping that are present in the abstract base class of the *Shade*.

The only requirement of creating a *Shade* is to include a method *determine_shade*, taking only (x,y) coordinates as an argument, and returning a color.

Here's an example of creating a shade that returns a completely random shade of grey each time:
```python
import shades
from random import randint

class RandomGrey(shades.Shade):
  def determine_shade(self, xy):
    mono = randint(0, 255)
    return (mono, mono, mono)

canvas = shades.Canvas(300,300)
my_shade = RandomGrey()

my_shade.triangle(canvas, (0, 0), (0, 300), (300, 150))

canvas.show()
```

### Examples

Here's a few examples of some short scripts and the images they create.

**Using SwirlOfShades which will either fill or not based on NoiseField returns**
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas()
shade = shades.SwirlOfShades(
  noise_field=shades.NoiseField(scale=0.005),
  shades=([
    (0.4, 0.6, shades.BlockColor((63, 151, 197)))
  ]),
)

shade.fill(canvas)
canvas.show()
```

**Drawing a circle using a DomainWarpGradient object**
```python
import shades

canvas = shades.Canvas()

shade = shades.DomainWarpGradient(
    color=(200,200,200),
    color_variance=70,
    noise_fields=[shades.NoiseField(scale=0.01) for i in range(3)],
    depth=2,
)

shade.circle(canvas, (canvas.width/2, canvas.height/2), canvas.width/3)

canvas.show()
```

**Integrating with Scipy's Delaunay function, to make a triangular grid**
```python
import shades
from random import randint
from scipy.spatial import Delaunay

canvas = shades.Canvas(1000, 800)
ink = shades.NoiseGradient(
    noise_fields=[shades.NoiseField(scale=0.002) for i in range(3)]
)

points = [(randint(0, canvas.width), randint(0, canvas.height)) for i in range(90)]
# plus some edge points to make sure the whole canvas is coloured
points.append((0, 0))
points.append((0, canvas.height))
points.append((canvas.width, 0))
points.append((canvas.width, canvas.height))
points.append((0, canvas.height/2))
points.append((canvas.width, canvas.height/2))
points.append((canvas.width/2, 0))
points.append((canvas.width/2, canvas.height))

# drawing triangles between points
for tri in Delaunay(points).simplices:
    ink.color = [randint(180, 255) for i in range(3)]
    ink.triangle(
        canvas,
        points[tri[0]],
        points[tri[1]],
        points[tri[2]],
    )

canvas.show()
```
