        ## Introduction
        `datools` is a collection of Python-based tools for working with data in relational databases. While it contains several utilities for smoothing the rough edges of SQL, its most baked component is `datools.diff`, an algorithm that's best explained in a [blog post](https://blog.marcua.net/2022/02/20/data-diffs-algorithms-for-explaining-what-changed-in-a-dataset.html) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb).

        ## Database support
        
        While `datools` generates SQL for its operations, different databases
        have their nuances. `datools` may run on your database today, but in
        an attempt to give you some certainty as to databases we know it has
        successfully run on, we run all tests in the test suite against the
        following databases:
        
        | Database      | Evaluated by test suite |
        | ----------- | ----------- |
        | SQLite      | Since v0.1.2 |
        | DuckDB   | Since v0.1.4 |
        | PostgreSQL   | Since v0.1.5 |
        | Redshift, Snowflake   | *You provide an instance, I'll make the tests pass* |
        
        
        # History
        
        ## 0.1.5 (2022-04-13)
        * Support for PostgreSQL! The test suite now runs against PostgreSQL, and `datools.explanations.diff` now allows you to ask "why" about data stored in Postgres. Get excited!
        * `datools.sqlalchemy_utils.grouping_sets_query` will now generate a GROUPING SETs query for databases that support grouping sets (e.g., Postgres, DuckDB) or the equivalent UNION ALL version for databases without grouping sets support (e.g., SQLite). For more, check out the [example in the docs](https://datools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#grouping-sets-query).
        
        ## 0.1.4 (2022-02-27)
        * Python 3.10 support.
        * Updated test suite to run tests against multiple databases, in particular expanding from SQLite only to DuckDB and SQLite.
        * As a result of the last bullet, ensured code runs against DuckDB in addition to SQLite.
        * First stab at documentation (https://datools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        
        ## 0.1.3 (2021-12-31)
        * Introduced mypy to linting and CI to ensure code that makes it to `main` has proper types.
        * Created first working example of [DIFF working on a real-world dataset as a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/marcua/datools/blob/main/examples/diff/intel-sensor.ipynb). This example partially replicates the Scorpion paper when only moteid/sensorids are considered.
        * Separated the `on_columns` argument of `diff` into `on_column_values` (columns for which you want to generate equality predicates as explanations) and and `on_column_ranges` (columns for which you want to generate range predicates as explanations after bucketing the ranges into 15 equi-sized buckets).
        
        ## 0.1.2 (2021-11-07)
        * First release of DIFF algorithm implementation.
        
        ## 0.1.0 (2021-05-09)
        * First release on PyPI.
