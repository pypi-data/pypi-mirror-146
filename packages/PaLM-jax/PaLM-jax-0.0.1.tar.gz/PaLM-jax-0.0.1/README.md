## PaLM - Jax (wip)

Implementation of the specific Transformer architecture from <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html">PaLM - Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways</a> - in Jax using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox">Equinox</a>

May as well start doing more Jax work, given Facebook (Meta's) uncertain future

<a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-pytorch">Pytorch version</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install palm-jax
```

## Usage

```python
import jax
from palm_jax import PaLM

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

model = PaLM(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64,
    key = key
)

seq = jax.random.randint(key, (1, 1024,), 0, 20000)

logits = model(seq) # (1, 1024, 20000)
```

## Todo

- [ ] fix jit error
