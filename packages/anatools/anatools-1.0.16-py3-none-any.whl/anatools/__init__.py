"""anatools is Rendered.aiâ€™s SDK for connecting to the Platform API. 

- The ``anatools.annotations`` package allows a User to generate annotations locally without the need for the Platform.
- The ``anatools.api`` package is used by the ``anatools.client`` package to access the api.
- The ``anatools.client`` package exposes the Platform API to the User. Everything that a user can do through the Platform Web Interface can be done via the SDK through the ``anatools.client`` package.

The SDK's submodule methods are all exposed to the user, so the full path is not required to call a specific method.
