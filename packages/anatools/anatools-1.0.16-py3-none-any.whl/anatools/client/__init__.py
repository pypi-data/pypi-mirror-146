"""The ``anatools.client`` package connects to Rendered.ai's Platform API. 

To get started, read through the Quickstart Guide in this doc. Additional support can be found at https://support.rendered.ai.

Currently, a channel can only be deployed via the SDK after it is created with the ANA codebase. 
View the `Channel Deployment Documentation`_ for more information.
