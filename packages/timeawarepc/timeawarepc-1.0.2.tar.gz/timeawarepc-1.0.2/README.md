# TimeAwarePC: A Python Package for Finding Causal Connectivity from Time Series Data  [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/timeawarepc/badge/?version=latest)](https://timeawarepc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/timeawarepc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/timeawarepc)
**TimeAwarePC** is a Python package that implements the Time-Aware PC Algorithm for finding the **Causal Functional Connectivity** from time series data, based on recent research in directed probabilistic graphical modeling with time series [[1]](#Citation). The package also includes implementations of Granger Causality and the PC algorithm.

## Installation

You can get the latest version of Time-Aware PC by cloning the repository:

```
git clone -b main https://github.com/shlizee/TimeAwarePC.git
cd TimeAwarePC
pip install .
```

## Requirements
- Python >=3.6
- Python packages automatically checked and installed as part of the setup. To use Granger Causality, additional dependency of ```nitime``` which can be installed by ```pip install nitime```.
- R >=4.0
- R package ```kpcalg``` and its dependencies. They can be installed in R or RStudio as follows:
```
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("graph")
BiocManager::install("RBGL")
install.packages("pcalg")
install.packages("kpcalg")
```
<!-- - In addition, if you like to use Granger Causality functions in this package, please separately install nitime as follows:
```
pip install nitime
``` -->
