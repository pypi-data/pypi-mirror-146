Image analyzer is an interface that simplifies interaction with image-related deep learning models. The interface has built-in features that get adjusted based on the models. You need to set the destination folder that contains your models with specific pattern names. The built-in features will use the names. 

The interface was initially part of an internal project that detects abusive content with the possibility of tracing the subjects.
