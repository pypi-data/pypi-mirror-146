## Readme

pyTFM is a python package that allows you to analyze force generation and stresses in cell colonies and confluent cell layers growing on a 2 dimensional surface. This package implements the procedures of [Traction Force Microscopy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11832345) and [Monolayer Stress Microscopy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055172). In addition to the standard measures for stress and force generation, it
also includes the line tension, a measure for the force transfer exclusively across cell-cell boundaries. 
pyTFM includes an addon for the image annotation tool [clickpoints](https://clickpoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allowing you to quickly analyze and vizualize large datasets.

Please refer to the [Documentation](https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of pyTFM for detailed instructions on installation and usage.
