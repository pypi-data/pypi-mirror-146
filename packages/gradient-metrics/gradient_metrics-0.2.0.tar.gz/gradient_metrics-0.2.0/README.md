# Installation

```python
pip install gradient-metrics
```

This package implements utilities for computing gradient metrics for measuring uncertainties in neural networks based on the paper "[Classification Uncertainty of Deep Neural Networks Based on Gradient Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08440)".

Documentation and examples can be found on [GitHub pages](https://ronmckay.github.io/gradient_metrics/).
