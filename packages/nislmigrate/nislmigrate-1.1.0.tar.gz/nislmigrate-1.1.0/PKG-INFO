# NI-SystemLink-Migration tool `nislmigrate`
`nislmigrate` is a command line utility for migration, backup, and restore of supported SystemLink services.

### Prerequisites
#### 1. SystemLink
- This tool offically supports migration between SystemLink versions 21.0, 21.1, 21.3, & 21.5. Other versions have not been tested.
- **We assume the server you are migrating to is clean with no data. Migrating to a server with existing data will result in data loss.**
- Services that are supported with any caveats and exceptions are detailed in the **Supported Services** section below.
- This tool assumes a single-box SystemLink installation.
- This tool must be run on the same machines as the SystemLink installations.
#### 2. Python
- This tool requires [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3811/) to run.
- The documentation in this repository assumes Python has been added to your [**PATH**](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
### Installation
The latest released version of the tool can be installed by running:
```bash
pip install nislmigrate
```
# Usage
### Backup

To backup the data for a service listed in the **Supported Services** section run the tool with elevated permissions and use the `capture` option with the corresponding flag for each of the services you want to back up (e.g. `--security`):
```bash
nislmigrate capture --security
```
This will backup the data corresponding with each service into the default migration directory (`C:\Users\[user]\Documents\migration\`). You can specify a different migration directory using the `--dir [path]` option:
```bash
nislmigrate capture --security --dir C:\custom-backup-location
```
To backup the data for all supported services at once, the `--all` flag can be used instead of listing out each individual service. Using `--all` will require that you include the `--secret` flag for services that require encrypting backed up data for security:
```bash
nislmigrate capture --all --secret <password>
```

### Restore

> :warning: Restoring requires the `--force` flag to explicitly allow overwriting the existing data on the server. Without it, the command will fail.

To restore the data for a service listed in the **Supported Services** section run the tool with elevated permissions and  use the `restore` option with the corresponding flag for each of the services you want to restore (e.g. `--security`):
```bash
nislmigrate restore --security
```
This will restore the data corresponding with each service from the default migration directory (`C:\Users\[user]\Documents\migration\`). If your captured data is in a different directory that can be specified with the `--dir [path]` option:
```bash
nislmigrate restore --security --dir C:\custom-backup-location
```
To restore the data for all supported services at once, the `--all` flag can be used instead of listing out each individual service. Using `--all` will require that you include the `--secret` flag for services that require encrypting backed up data for security:
```bash
nislmigrate restore --all --secret <password>
```

### Modify

To modify entries in the database in-place without doing a restore run the tool with elevated permissions and use the `modify` option. `modify` currently only works to modify the files' service database entries.

#### Updating after moving files

After moving the storage location of the files uploaded to the Files service the database will need to be updated to reflect the new location. The `--files-change-file-store-root` argument can be used for this, either as part of a `restore` operation or in-place as part of a `modify` operation. When used with `restore` the old root location is inferred from the database. When used with `modify` the old root location must be specified with the `--files-file-store-root` argument.

> :warning: `modify` will modify the database directly. A backup of the database should be taken before any modifiations using `nislmigrate capture --files --files-metadata-only`

To modify the files root location after moving the files to a new drive:
```bash
cp -r -f C:\old\file\store X:\new\file\store
nislmigrate modify --files --files-change-file-store-root X:\new\file\store --files-file-store-root C:\old\file\store
```

To modify the files root location after moving the files to an S3 bucket:
```bash
aws s3 sync C:\old\file\store s3://my-systemlink-bucket/my-files
nislmigrate modify --files --files-change-file-store-root s3://my-systemlink-bucket/my-files --files-file-store-root C:\old\file\store --files-switch-to-forward-slashes
```

### Migration
>:warning: Server B must be a clean SystemLink installation, any existing data will be deleted.

To migrate from one SystemLink server instance (`server A`) to a different instance (`server B`):
1. Install the migration tool on `server A` and `server B`.
2. Follow the backup instructions to backup the data from `server A`.
3. Copy the data produced by the backup of `server A` on `server B`.
4. **_Warning:_** Ensure `server B` is a clean SystemLink installation, any existing data will be deleted.
5. Follow the restore instructions to restore the backed up data onto `server B`.

# Development
See `CONTRIBUTING.MD` for detailed instructions on developing, testing, and releasing the tool.

# Supported Services
The services that can be migrated with this utility along with short descriptions can be listed by running:
```bash
nislmigrate capture -h
```

Most services require migrating the `--security` service at the same time for the migration to be successful, and some services have additional dependencies which are listed in the table below.

- OPC UA Client: `--opc`
- TDM `--tdm`
- Cloud Connector `--cloud`
