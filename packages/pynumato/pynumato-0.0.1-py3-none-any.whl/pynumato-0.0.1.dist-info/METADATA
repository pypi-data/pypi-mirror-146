Pynumato
========

Pynumato allows to control relay modules (ON or OFF states).
This module is only compatible with the Numato series `1-2-4-8 Channels USB Solid State Relay Module`, listed in the following link : `<https://numato.com/?s=Channel+USB+Solid+State+Relay+Module>`.

Requirement
-----------

The module requires the minimum configuration :

- Windows7 64-bits
- Linux 64-bits
- Python3.7

How to use it
-------------

The command line to drive relays are :

```
python3 -m pynumato.pynumato --cmd=<string to drive relays> --relays=<Number of relays> --port=<port> --baudrate=<baudrate>
```

Parameters are :

- the number of relays to drive (default is 1)

- the port (default is /dev/ttyUSB1)

- the baudrate (default is 921600)

- the command to drive relays

A relay can receive two types of orders (OFF or ON). The order in the module is encoding by an ASCII character such as :

`"c"` : close the relay (OFF state)

`"o"` : open the relay (ON state)

`"x"` : do not change the current state of the relay  

In an example, if we have :

- 4 available relays : 0, 1, 2 and 3
- baudrate is 921600
- port is COM27

To turn on all relays, string command is `oooo` and the command line is :
```
python3 -m pynumato.pynumato --cmd="oooo" --relays=2 --port="COM27" --baudrate=921600
```

To turn off all relays, string command is `cccc` and the command line is :
```
python3 -m pynumato.pynumato --cmd="cccc" --relays=2 --port="COM27" --baudrate=921600
```

To turn on the relay 0, and it does not matter about other ones, string command is `oxxx` and the command line is :
```
python3 -m pynumato.pynumato --cmd="oxxx" --relays=2 --port="COM27" --baudrate=921600
```

To turn on the relays 1 and 3, and it does not matter about other ones, string command is `xoxo`and the command line is :
```
python3 -m pynumato.pynumato --cmd="xoxo" --relays=2 --port="COM27" --baudrate=921600
```
