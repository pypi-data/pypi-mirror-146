DISCERN
=======

DISCERN is a deep learning approach to reconstruction expression information
of single-cell RNAseq data sets using a high quality reference.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
An interactive tutorial can be found in `Tutorial.ipynb <https://github.com/imsb-uke/discern/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb>`_.


Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ for dependency management. You can get poetry by

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install poetry

or (the officially recommended way)

.. code-block:: sh

   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

To get discern you can clone the repository by

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/imsb-uke/discern.git

poetry can be used to install all further dependencies in an virtual environment.

.. code-block:: sh

   cd discern
   poetry install --no-dev

To finally run discern you can also directly use poetry with

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run commands

or spawn a new shell in the virtual environment

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry shell

For further examples the first approach is presented.

Using discern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the main function of discern for most use cases. Usually you have to preprocess your data by:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern process <parameters.json>

An example parameters.json is provided together with an hyperparameter_search.json for hyperparameter optimization using ray[tune].
The training can be done with

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern train <parameters.json>

Hyperparameter optimization needs a ray server with can be started with

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run ray start --head --port 57780 --redis-password='password'

and can started with

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern optimize <parameters.json>

For projection 2 different modes are available:
Eval mode, which is a more general approach and can save a lot of files:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern project --all_batches <parameters.json>

Or projection mode which offers a more fine grained controll to which is projected.

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern project --metadata="metadatacolumn:value" --metadata="metadatacolumn:" <parameters.json>

which creates to files, one is projected to the average batch calculated by a
``metadatacolumn`` and a contained ``value``.
The second file is projected to the the average for each value in "metadatacolumn"; individually.

DISCERN also supports online training. You can add new batches to your dataset after the usual ``train`` with:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run discern onlinetraining --freeze --filename=<new_not_preprocessed_batch[es].h5ad> <parameters.json>

The data gets automatically preprocessed and added to the dataset. You can run ``project`` afterwards as usual (without the ``--filename`` flag).
``--freeze`` is important to freeze non-conditional layers in training.

Testing
^^^^^^^

For critical parts of the model several tests has been implemented. They can be run with:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run pytest --cov=discern --cov-report=term

(Requires the development version of discern).

Some tests are slow and don't run by default, but you can run them using:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run pytest --runslow --cov=discern --cov-report=term

Coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enforce code style guidlines `pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ and `mypy <http://mypy-lang.org/>`_ are use. Example commands are shown below:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run pylint discern ray_hyperpara.py
   poetry run mypy discern ray_hyperpara.py

For automatic code formatting `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ was used:

.. code-block:: sh

   yapf -i <filename.py>

These tools are included in the dev-dependencies.
