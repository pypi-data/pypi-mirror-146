Description: Hello world program to test uploading a package to PyPi.
        
        This package contains a simple program that runs OCR on an input image.
        The OCR is powered by pytesseract which works well for structured text such as webpages or book scans.  
        It does not do well with unstructured text images such as words on a t-shirt or text on x-ray scans.
        
        ``` 
        pip install hello-world-ocr
        ```
        
        Once the package has been installed, bring up your python interpreter and run the following commands which will 
        1) import the ocr module, and 
        2) print out the text scanned from the image using ocr.scan()
        
        ``` python
        import ocr
        
        # Assuming you have an image in your current directory called article.png
        image = "article.png"
        print(ocr.scan(image))
        ```
