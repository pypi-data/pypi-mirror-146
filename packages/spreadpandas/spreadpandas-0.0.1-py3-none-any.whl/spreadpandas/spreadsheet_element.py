class SpreadsheetElement:
    """
    Class to describe a rectangular portion of a spreadsheet.

    Identify a rectangular part of a spreadsheet by providing a pair of
    coordinates that represent the top left and bottom right corner of the
    rectangle.

    This object allows to access the various forms in which the rectangle
    of cells can be identified (cells, coordinates, cells_range).

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]
        A tuple containing two tuples of length two, each containing two numbers
        which univocally identify a cell. The two numbers are indexes of the
        respectively the columns and rows. The two cells are the top left and
        bottom right one.
