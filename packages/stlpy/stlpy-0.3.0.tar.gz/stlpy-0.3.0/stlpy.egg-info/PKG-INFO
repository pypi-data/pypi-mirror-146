Description: 
        A python library for control from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications.
        
        This software is designed with the following goals in mind:
        
        - Provide a simple python interface for dealing with STL formulas
        - Provide high-quality implementations of several state-of-the-art synthesis 
          algorithms, including Mixed-Integer Convex Programming (MICP) and 
          gradient-based optimization.
        - Make it easy to design and evaluate new synthesis algorithms.
        - Provide a variety of benchmark scenarios that can be used to test new algorithms.
