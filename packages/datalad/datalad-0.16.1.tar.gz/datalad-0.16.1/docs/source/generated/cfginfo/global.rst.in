  datalad.clone.url-substitute.github    
    GitHub URL substitution rule:
    Mangling for GitHub-related URL. A substitution specification is a string with a match and substitution
    expression, each following Python's regular expression syntax. Both expressions
    are concatenated to a single string with an arbitrary delimiter character. The
    delimiter is defined by prefixing the string with the delimiter. Prefix and
    delimiter are stripped from the expressions (Example:
    ",^http://(.*)$,https://\1").  This setting can be defined multiple times.
    Substitutions will be applied incrementally, in order of their definition. The
    first substitution in such a series must match, otherwise no further
    substitutions in a series will be considered. However, following the first
    match all further substitutions in a series are processed, regardless whether
    intermediate expressions match or not.
    Default: (',https?://github.com/([^/]+)/(.*)$,\\1###\\2', ',[/\\\\]+,-', ',\\s+|(%2520)+|(%20)+,_', ',([^#]+)###(.*),https://github.com/\\1/\\2')
