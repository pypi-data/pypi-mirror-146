# Mechmean

This Python package contains selected mean field methods
in the context of continuum mechanics
with special focus on orientation averaged homogenization
<!--
and is utilied , e.g., in
```bibtex
@article{insertdoihere?,
	author = {Julian Karl Bauer and Thomas Böhlke},
	title ={On the dependence of orientation averaged mean field homogenization on planar fourth order fiber orientation tensors},
	journal = {?},
}
``` -->

The implementation is oriented as close as possible to the cited references
and no emphasis is placed on run time optimization.
Therefore, this package should be considered as a reference implementation
which can be used to cross-validate performance-optimized implementation.
