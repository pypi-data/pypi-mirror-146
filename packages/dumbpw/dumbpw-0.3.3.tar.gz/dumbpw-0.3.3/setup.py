Then, a very strong passphrase is used to lock the password manager.\n\nUnfortunately, in a misguided attempt to encourage users to choose better\npasswords, many websites and apps enforce `restrictive password policies <https://kottke.org/12/06/the-worlds-worst-password-requirements-list>`_\nthat place restrictions on what sorts of characters must be (or may not be) in\na password. These policies inhibit users from using cryptographically random\npassword generators: a long, high-entropy password is more likely to\nviolate such rules, which means a security-savvy user may have to attempt\nseveral "random" passwords before one is accepted. This punishes users\nwho are trying to follow best practices.\n\nEnter dumbpw. dumbpw allows you to configure a set of rules, and then it will\ngenerate a cryptographically secure password that conforms to those dumb rules.\n\nIf all you need is a password generator, **you should not use this**.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block :: console\n\n    pip3 install dumbpw\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block :: console\n\n    $ dumbpw --help\n    Usage: dumbpw [OPTIONS] LENGTH\n\n    Options:\n      --version                       Show the version and exit.\n      --min-uppercase INTEGER         The minimum number of uppercase characters.\n      --min-lowercase INTEGER         The minimum number of lowercase characters.\n      --min-digits INTEGER            The minimum number of digit characters.\n      --min-specials INTEGER          The minimum number of special characters.\n      --blocklist TEXT                Characters that may not be in the password.\n                                      [default: \'";]\n      --allow-repeating / --reject-repeating\n                                      Allow or reject repeating characters in the\n                                      password.  [default: reject-repeating]\n      --help                          Show this message and exit.\n\nKnown issues\n------------\n* dumbpw uses `secrets <https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html>`_\n  to generate passwords. If the generated string doesn\'t meet the given\n  requirements, dumbpw discards it and generates another, until one passes.\n  Therefore, if you ask dumbpw to generate a long password with high minimums,\n  it will run for a very long time before terminating.\n* Likewise, if your minimums require characters that are banned in the\n  blocklist option, dumbpw will run forever.\n* The author is neither a cryptographer, nor a security expert.
