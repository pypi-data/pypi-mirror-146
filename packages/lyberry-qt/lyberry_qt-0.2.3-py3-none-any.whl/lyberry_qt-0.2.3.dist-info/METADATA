# LyBerry

A Qt LBRY client that uses the LyBerry Api

## Status

Still in an early stage, but many essential features are in place.

- Following Feed
- Watch Videos (in configurable external video player)
- Read Articles (in configurable external text reader)
- Read / Write Comments

## Usage

install with pip

```
pip install lyberry-qt
```

run

```
lyberry-qt
```

Videos will probably open in your browser by default. To change this go to the settings page (in the Qt version) and change player\_cmd to your video player.

You can also change settings in conf.json in your relevant config directory. (eg on linux edit ~/.config/lyberry/conf.json)

If some thumbnails are not showing you may need to install a Qt image format library on your system. Search for this using your package manager.
