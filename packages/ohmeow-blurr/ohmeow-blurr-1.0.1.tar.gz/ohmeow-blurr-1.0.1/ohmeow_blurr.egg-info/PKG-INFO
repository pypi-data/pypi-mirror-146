# blurr
> A library designed for fastai developers who want to train and deploy Hugging Face transformers


Named after the **fast**est **transformer** (well, at least of the Autobots), **BLURR** provides both a comprehensive and extensible framework for training and deploying 🤗 [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) transformer models with [fastai](http://docs.fast.ai/) >= 2.0.

Utilizing features like fastai's new `@typedispatch` and `@patch` decorators, along with a simple class hiearchy, **BLURR** provides fastai developers with the ability to train and deploy transformers on a variety of tasks. It includes a high, mid, and low-level API that will allow developers to use much of it out-of-the-box or customize it as needed.

**Supported Text/NLP Tasks**:
- Sequence Classification (multiclassification and multi-label classification)
- Token Classification
- Question Answering
- Summarization
- Tranlsation
- Language Modeling (Causal and Masked)

**Supported Vision Tasks**:
- *In progress*

**Supported Audio Tasks**:
- *In progress*

## Install

You can now pip install blurr via `pip install ohmeow-blurr`

Or, even better as this library is under *very* active development, create an editable install like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/ohmeow/blurr.git
cd blurr
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## How to use

Please check the documentation for more thorough examples of how to use this package.

The following two packages need to be installed for blurr to work:
1. fastai (see http://docs.fast.ai/ for installation instructions)
2. huggingface transformers (see https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html for details)

### Imports

```python
import torch
from transformers import *
from fastai.text.all import *

from blurr.text.data.all import *
from blurr.text.modeling.all import *

```

### Get your data

```python
path = untar_data(URLs.IMDB_SAMPLE)

model_path = Path("models")
imdb_df = pd.read_csv(path / "texts.csv")

```

### Get `n_labels` from data for config later

```python
n_labels = len(imdb_df["label"].unique())

```

### Get your 🤗 objects

```python
model_cls = AutoModelForSequenceClassification

pretrained_model_name = "bert-base-uncased"

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name)
config.num_labels = n_labels

hf_arch, hf_config, hf_tokenizer, hf_model = NLP.get_hf_objects(pretrained_model_name, model_cls=model_cls, config=config)

```

### Build your Data 🧱 and your DataLoaders

```python
# single input
blocks = (TextBlock(hf_arch, hf_config, hf_tokenizer, hf_model), CategoryBlock)
dblock = DataBlock(blocks=blocks, get_x=ColReader("text"), get_y=ColReader("label"), splitter=ColSplitter())

dls = dblock.dataloaders(imdb_df, bs=4)

```

```python
dls.show_batch(dataloaders=dls, max_n=2)

```

      <td>i rented the dubbed - english version of lensman, hoping that since it came from well - known novels it would have some substance. while there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. but for whatever reason, there wasn't much there. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; i noticed lots of details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. some examples : the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 " star gate " scene and the star wars image of hyperspace. the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized " r2 - d2 ". &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars, but mercifully ( since the humor doesn't work ) gives up on comedy and plays it serious. in that sense, it's superior to the star wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to jar - jar's annoying silliness. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field, dumping silage onto unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already - harvested rows or into a truck. corn ( maize ) was pouring out the grain chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; when it was time for kim's father had to face his fate, there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene. that could have been partly the fault of the english - language voice actor, but the drawings didn't show much weight either. kim's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; similarly, when a character named henderson was killed, chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. ( henderson's death is no spoiler ; his name isn't revealed until his death scene. ) she seems to promptly forget him. someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that</td>

### Using the high-level Blurr API

Using the high-level API we can reduce DataBlock, DataLoaders, and Learner creation into a ***single line of code***.

Included in the high-level API is a general `BLearner` class (pronouned **"Blurrner"**) that you can use with hand crafted DataLoaders, as well as, task specific BLearners like `BLearnerForSequenceClassification` that will handle everything given your raw data sourced from a pandas DataFrame, CSV file, or list of dictionaries (for example a huggingface datasets dataset)

```python
# slow
learn = BlearnerForSequenceClassification.from_data(imdb_df, pretrained_model_name, dl_kwargs={"bs": 4})

```

```python
# slow
learn.fit_one_cycle(1, lr_max=1e-3)
