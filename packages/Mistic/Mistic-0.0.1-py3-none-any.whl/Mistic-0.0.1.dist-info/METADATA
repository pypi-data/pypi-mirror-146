Mistic: image tSNE visualizer
=============================

This is a Python tool using the Bokeh library to view multiple multiplex
images simultaneously. The code has been tested on 7-panel Vectra TIFF,
32- & 64-panel CODEX TIFF, 16-panel CODEX QPTIFF and 44-panel t-CyCIF
TIFF images.

Mistic’s GUI with user inputs is shown below:

**Figure description:** A sample Mistic GUI with user inputs is shown.
**A.** User-input panel where imaging technique choice, stack montage
option or markers can be selected, images borders can be added, new or
pre-defined image display coordinates can be chosen, and a theme for the
canvases can be selected. **B.** Static canvas showing the image t-SNE
colored and arranged as per user inputs. **C.** Live canvas showing the
corresponding t-SNE scatter plot where each image is represented as a
dot. The live canvas has tabs for displaying additional information per
image. Metadata for each image can be obtained by hovering over each
dot.

Features of Mistic
------------------

-  Two canvases:

   -  still canvas with the image tSNE rendering
   -  live canvases with tSNE scatter plots for image metadata rendering

-  Dropdown option to select the imaging technique: Vectra, t-CyCIF, or
   CODEX
-  Option to choose between Stack montage view or multiple multiplexed
   images by selecting the markers to be visualised at once
-  Option to place a border around each image based on image metadata
-  Option to use a pre-defined tSNE or generate a new set of tSNE
   co-ordinates
-  Option to shuffle images with the tSNE co-ordinates
-  Option to render multiple tSNE scatter plots based on image metadata
-  Hover functionality available on the tSNE scatter plot to get more
   information of each image
-  Save, zoom, etc each of the Bokeh canvases

Requirements
------------

-  Python >= 3.6 

   -  Install Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
