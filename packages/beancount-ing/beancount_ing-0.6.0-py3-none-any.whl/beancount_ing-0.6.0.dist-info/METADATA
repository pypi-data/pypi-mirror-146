`beancount-ing` provides an Importer for converting CSV exports of
[ING-DiBa] (Germany) account summaries to the [Beancount] format.

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install beancount-ing
```

In case you prefer installing from the Github repository, please note that
`develop` is the development branch so `stable` is what you should be installing
from.

## Usage

If you're not familiar with how to import external data into Beancount, please
read [this guide] first.

Adjust your [config file] to include the provided `ECImporter`. A sample
configuration might look like the following:

```python
from beancount_ing import ECImporter

CONFIG = [
    # ...

    ECImporter(
        IBAN_NUMBER,
        'Assets:INGDiBa:EC',
        'Max Mustermann',
        file_encoding='ISO-8859-1',
    ),

    # ...
]
```

Once this is in place, you should be able to run `bean-extract` on the command
line to extract the transactions and pipe all of them into your Beancount file.

```sh
$ bean-extract /path/to/config.py transaction.csv >> you.beancount
```

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome!

Please make sure you have Python 3.6+ and [Poetry] installed.
