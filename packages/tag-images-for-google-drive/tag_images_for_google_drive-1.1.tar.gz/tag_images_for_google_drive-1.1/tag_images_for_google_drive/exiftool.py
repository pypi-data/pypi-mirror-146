"""
PyExifTool is a Python library to communicate with an instance of Phil
Harvey's excellent ExifTool_ command-line application.  The library
provides the class :py:class:`ExifTool` that runs the command-line
tool in batch mode and features methods to send commands to that
program, including methods to extract meta-information from one or
more image files.  Since ``exiftool`` is run in batch mode, only a
single instance needs to be launched and can be reused for many
queries.  This is much more efficient than launching a separate
process for every single query.

    You can pass the file name of the ``exiftool`` executable as an
    argument to the constructor.  The default value ``exiftool`` will
    only work if the executable is in your ``PATH``.

    Most methods of this class are only available after calling
    :py:meth:`start()`, which will actually launch the subprocess.  To
    avoid leaving the subprocess running, make sure to call
    :py:meth:`terminate()` method when finished using the instance.
    This method will also be implicitly called when the instance is
    garbage collected, but there are circumstance when this won't ever
    happen, so you should not rely on the implicit process
    termination.  Subprocesses won't be automatically terminated if
    the parent process exits, so a leaked subprocess will stay around
    until manually killed.

    A convenient way to make sure that the subprocess is terminated is
    to use the :py:class:`ExifTool` instance as a context manager::

        with ExifTool() as et:
            ...

    .. warning:: Note that there is no error handling.  Nonsensical
       options will be silently ignored by exiftool, so there's not
       much that can be done in that regard.  You should avoid passing
       non-existent files to any of the methods, since this will lead
       to undefied behaviour.
