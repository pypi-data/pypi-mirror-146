KerasCV is a repository of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data-augmentation) that
applied computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art
training and inference pipelines for common use cases such as image classification, object detection, 
image segmentation, image data augmentation, etc. 

KerasCV can be understood as a horizontal extension of the Keras API: the components are new first-party 
Keras objects (layers, metrics, etc) that are too specialized to be added to core Keras, but that receive 
the same level of polish and backwards compatibility guarantees as the rest of the Keras API and that 
are maintained by the Keras team itself (unlike TFAddons).

Currently, KerasCV is operating pre-release.  Upon launch of KerasCV 1.0, full API docs and code examples
will be available.  To learn more about the project, please check the [roadmap](.github/ROADMAP.md).
