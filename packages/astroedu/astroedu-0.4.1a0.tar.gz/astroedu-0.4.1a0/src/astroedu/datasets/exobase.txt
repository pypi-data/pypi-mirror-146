From A. Garcia Munoz et al - Upper Atmospheres and Ionospheres of Planets and Satellites
https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf

Contains data on the exobase (bottom layer of the exosphere) for the planets and Titan.

object - name of the object  
exobase alt - altitude in the atmosphere of the exobase (km)  
exobase alt range - if the value in the paper was given as a range exobase alt is the center value
and this column contains the range either side of possible values (similar to a +- error but I hesitate to call it that) in km  
exobase temp high - max temp of the exobase in K (daytime)  
exobase temp low - min temp of the exobase in K (nightime) - sometimes this is the same as the high value  
esc vel - the escape velocity of the planet in km/s

Note the temperatures for Mercury are average surface temperatures since it has no appreciable atmosphere.
