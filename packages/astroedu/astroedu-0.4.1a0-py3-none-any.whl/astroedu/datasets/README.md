# Data

Description of the data files kept in this directory.

To keep this readme short you can find column descriptions in the csv's associated **.txt** file or linked below. (not all are complete)

## mass16Abundant.csv

Atomic data (mass, binding energy etc of isotopes) from the Atomic Mass Data Center ([AMDC](http://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/filel.html)).
**mass16Abundant.csv** is the same but with only the most abundant isotope of each element.

## atmospheres.csv

Data from Rauf KM et al. (2015) Comparing the Atmospheric Compositions of All Planets and Giant Moons in Solar System [https://www.longdom.org/open-access/comparing-the-atmospheric-compositions-of-all-planets-and-giant-moons-in-solar-system-2332-2519-1000136.pdf](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/comparing-the-atmospheric-compositions-of-all-planets-and-giant-moons-in-solar-system-2332-2519-1000136.pdf) 

Contains percentage compositions for different gases in the atmospheres of the planets + Pluto.

## earth_chem_crust.csv

Chemical composition of the crust.
Taken from: CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 97th Edition (2016-2017)

## earth_chem_interior.csv

The chemical compostion of the Earth.
Only some elements included. Some Oxygen data is missing. Values in %.

Rows for: Bulk, Core, Lower Mantle, Upper Mantle, and the Crust.

Data taken from:  
Don L. Anderson (1998) Theory of the Earth, Chapter 8, [https://authors.library.caltech.edu/25018/9/TOE08.pdf](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/25018/9/TOE08.pdf)

## exobase.csv

From A. Garcia Munoz et al - Upper Atmospheres and Ionospheres of Planets and Satellites [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.02994.pdf)

Contains data on the exobase (bottom layer of the exosphere) for the planets and Titan.  
Note the temperatures for Mercury are average surface temperatures since it has no appreciable atmosphere.

## exoplanets.csv
