geotherm.csv
Data taken from - Professor Bob Downs, University of Arizona
https://www.geo.arizona.edu/xtal/geos306/fall06-10.htm

Used to construct/plot the Earth's geothermal gradient.  
r - depth (km)  
r*- distance from the center of the Earth (km)  
T - temperature at r (K)  

I have altered the T profile from the original to be consistent with the D" layer depth.
In the original file the core mantle boundary temp change occurred at too low a depth.
The original data is in geotherm_original.csv. The original also has pressure vs depth data.
