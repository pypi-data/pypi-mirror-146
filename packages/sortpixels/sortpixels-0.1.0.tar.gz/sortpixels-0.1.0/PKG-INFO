Sort-Image provides the ImageSorter class. You can use it to sort the pixels in an 
image by calling methods on that class.  Typical usage
often looks like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from sortimage import ImageSorter

    image = ImageSorter("input.png")
    new_image = image.sortimage()
    new_image.save("output.png")
