# Sortty - simple combination of advanced sorters

The main benefit is the function ```get_multi_sorted```. It makes it easy to sort a sequence by several criteria at the
same time. All sorting parameters can always be set manually, but they can also be determined automatically.

Attention! For **simple sorting**, for example, from minimum to maximum sorter usage **will be redundant and slow**, for
such situations write 1 line of code using the standard library:) Or rewrite this method in MinSorter class...
