Description: # Inspector Facet
        
        A tool that allows you to inspect deployed [EIP-2535 Diamond proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)
        contracts from your command line.
        
        Inspector Facet was inspired by [Louper.dev](https://louper.dev/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mark3labs/louper-v2)).
        
        Inspector Facet uses side information about facet ABIs to match the selectors that a Diamond proxy
        is serving to human-understandable information about the facets and the functions.
        
        We support side information obtained from:
        
        - [x] [brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) build artifacts
        - [ ] [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) build artifacts
        - [ ] Etherscan/Polygonscan/etc.
        
        We support Diamond introspection:
        
        - [x] Using the `DiamondLoupeFacet` interface
        - [ ] From `DiamondCut` events crawled from the blockchain (using the [Moonstream API](https://moonstream.to)).
        
        ### Installation

        To use Inspector Facet with:
        
        #### A `brownie` project
        
        The following command produces human-readable output:
        
        ```bash
        inspector-facet \
            --network <brownie network name for blockchain> \
            --address <address of diamond contract> \
            --project <path to brownie project (should contain build artifacts in build/contracts)> \
            --format human
        ```
        
        The following command produces JSON output and can be used to inspect a Diamond contract programatically
        (e.g. as part of a CI/CD pipeline):
        ```bash
        inspector-facet \
            --network <brownie network name for blockchain> \
            --address <address of diamond contract> \
            --project <path to brownie project (should contain build artifacts in build/contracts)> \
            --format json
        ```
