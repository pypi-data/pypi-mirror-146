Description
===========
TyphoonTest is a testing framework that provides high-level functions to test power electronics
and power systems equipment. It also provides integration with pytest and Allure framework.
Thanks to this integration, all Typhoon HIL API and TyphoonTest functions used in pytest tests are automatically logged
in Allure report.

Requirements
============
Typhoon API requires Typhoon HIL Control Center (with an appropriate license)
to be installed.
For other requirements, they will be automatically installed when you perform
installation using pip.

Installation
============
Package is available on PyPI

To install TyphoonTest library use:
    ``pip install typhoontest``

Reading hdf files exported with typhoon capture functionality is currently not available on Python 3.9. If you want to use this feature with python versions older than that (3.6 - 3.8) you can install it as extra feature:
    ``pip install typhoontest[read_hdf]``

Supported Python versions
=========================
TyphoonTest is available for python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. The wheels are built for both Windows and Linux
platform
