gRPC Typing Stubs for Python
============================

This is a PEP-561-compliant stub-only package which provides type information of
`gRPC <https://grpc.io>`_.

Install using pip::

    pip install grpc-stubs


Tests (courtesy of `pytest-mypy-plugins <https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins>`_)::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ./tools.sh test


## Contributing

### Minimum Reproducible Examples (MRE)

Due to a series of incomplete PRs, starting from 2022-04-16, fairly strict issue and pull request
templates have been added. Minimum Reproducible Examples are now a hard requirement for pull requests,
and a soft requirement for issues. Incomplete PRs simply transfer the burden from the contributor to
the maintainer, and I simply don't have time to do the deep-dives required to rebuild MREs from scratch
when the issues from incomplete PRs inevitably crop up. 

### Code-generated stubs

PRs containing auto-generated stubs have had to be reverted several times due to issues. Starting
from 2022-04-16, autogenerated stubs from `mypy-protobuf` will not be accepted without extensive
tests, and will not be accepted with edit warnings left in. It's ok to use this tool to seed stubs,
but not to refresh stubs - once contributed to this repo, the stubs should be presumed to have been
written by hand.


## Calls for assistance

### Stubs for `aio` packages

Several attempts have been made to contribute stubs for the `aio` packages, but have had to be reverted.
A more substantive contribution would be very welcome, even if that is in the form of some MREs; I'm not
sufficiently involved with `grpc` on a daily basis any more to be able to confidently integrate it myself
without assistance.

### Maintainers

It's unlikely I'll be returning to grpc full-time for the foreseeable future, and my knowledge of the
minutiae fades with each passing year. If anyone wishes to assume maintainership of this project ongoing,
please reach out.
