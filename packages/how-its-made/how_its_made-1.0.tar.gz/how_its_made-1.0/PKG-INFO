## Requirements

How it's made requires two packages, gTTS and pyttsx3, which can be installed using:

```bash
pip3 install gTTS pyttsx3
```
## Example
The command below will print, and then read aloud "How It's Made."
```bash
python3 how_its_made.py 1
```
The module can also be called within code, where the depth and the "it" can be customised.

```python
how = how_its_made(3, "a chair")

# This will print "How How How A Chair's Made Is Made Is Made"
print(how.title)

# This will then create a 'how_its_made.mp3' file using Google's Text to Speech package
how.text_to_speech(delete_sound_file=True)
```
