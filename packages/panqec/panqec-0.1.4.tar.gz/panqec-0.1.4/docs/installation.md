# Installation

PyMatching can be downloaded and installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PanQEC/) with the command::

```bash
pip install panqec
```

If instead you would like to install PanQEC from source, clone the repository and then use `pip` to install::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehua7365/panqec
pip install -e ./panqec
```
