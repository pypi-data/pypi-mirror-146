# HTML Index
A python script that generates index.html files for file indexing.

## Usage
Simply type `index <path>`.

Replace the `<path>` with the path to the directory you want to generate indexes for.

For example: `index ./`

### Optional Arguments
```
-h, --help                  show this help message and exit

--title TITLE               change the title of the index.
                            (`#DIR`: the directory path)
                            (default: "Index of #DIR"

--parent_dir PARENT_DIR     change the name of the "parent directory"
                            button in the index.
                            (default: "parent directory")

--filename FILENAME         change the name of the field "File Name" in the table.
                            (default: "File Name")

--size SIZE                 change the name of the field "Size" in the table.
                            (default: "Size")

--modified MODIFIED         change the name of the field "Last Modified" in the table.
                            (default: "Last Modified")
```
For example:
```
index --title "檢索中: #DIR"
      --parent_dir "往上一層"
      --filename "檔案名稱"
      --size "大小"
      --modified "最後修改日期"
      ./
```

## Note
Files started with `.` will be completely ignored.

Files started with `__` will be processed, but will not show up in `index.html`. \
Currently this is for wrapping `.url` files while not showing them.
- For example:
    > if I have a `abc.url`, \
it'll be wrapped into a `.abc` directory with a `index.html` \
that redirects you to whatever `abc.url` links to \
and it'll be shown as `abc` in the index

    > but if I don't want to show `abc.url` in the index \
it should be renamed to `__abc.url` \
so it'll still be looked at and wrapped, but not indexed.


## Customizing
Under `html-index/assets`, there are several files.
* `__file_template.html`
    * This is the template for indexed files, edit it if you want to change how the indexed files look.
* `__index_template.html`
    * This is the template for the `index.html`, edit it if you want to change how the whole index looks.
* `__icons/`
    * Where all the icons are located.
* `icons.yml`
    * The icon settings.
        * Note that it's currently generated by a script and still needs configuration.
