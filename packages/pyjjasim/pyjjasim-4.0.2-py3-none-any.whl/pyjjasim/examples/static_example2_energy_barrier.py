EXAMPLE 2: Energy barrier

Compute energy barrier for a vortex to move to a neighbouring site.
This is done by computing a "junction-vortex" state where the vortex is centered on
the junction in between the two sites (such a state is unstable). The energy
barrier is then the difference in the energy of both states.

The junction-vortex is achieved using the problem method .approximate_placed_vortices(x, y, n).
This results in an approximation that can be used as an initial guess.
