## About Firelight
[Firelight](https://github.com/roshie548/firelight) is an open source bias lighting program which syncs up colored lights to the contents of your screen or TV, providing an immersive experience.

## Installation
To install:
```
pip install firelight-lighting
```

To install directly from Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/roshie548/firelight.git
cd firelight
pip install .
```

## Usage
Currently, Firelight only supports LIFX lights. To start the application, simply run:
```
firelight lifx
```
Firelight will automatically discover the lights connected to your WiFi network and will start syncing their colors to your screen. Please make sure that the lights are on to see the effect. You can exit the application at any time by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

For best results, use Firelight when watching full screen movies. Firelight does not work well with general web browsing, as it will try to pick interesting colors on your screen. This could mean lots of jitter when using for general use. I may consider adding a general use mode in the future.

## Asking for help or requesting features
If you need some help or would like more features added, please open an issue.
Also, feel free to submit pull requests for any features you'd like to add yourself.

## TODO features
These are features/improvements that I would like to tackle next:

- Add Philips Hue compatibility
- Investigate interactions with scenes that include many bright, shifting colors that cause rapid flashing or color changes
