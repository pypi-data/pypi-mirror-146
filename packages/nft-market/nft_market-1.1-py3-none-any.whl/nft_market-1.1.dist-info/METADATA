Tofu, PancakeSwap, etc) can be obtained.

marketplace.

```python
from nft_market import Market, Retriever

r = Retriever()
print(r.fetch(Market.OpenSea, 'boredapeyachtclub'))  # Bored Ape Yacht Club

# [Output]
# type: nft_market.NFTInfo
# NFTInfo(name='boredapeyachtclub', num_items_all=None, num_listing=10000, num_owners=6400, floor=110.0, volume=487100.0)
```
