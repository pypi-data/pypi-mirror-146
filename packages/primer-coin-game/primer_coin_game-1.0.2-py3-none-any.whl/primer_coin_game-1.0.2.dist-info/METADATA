# Python Implementation of Primer Coin Game

Python implementation of Primer's Coin Game which can be used for testing and simulations.
To find out more about the game see [Primer's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC91Bf8hQVo/) and try the [original game](https://primerlearning.org/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run the simulator you just need Python 3.6+ installed.

Go to https://www.python.org/ for instruction how to install Python on your machine.
Use pip to install the package, e.g.:
```
# python3 -m pip install --upgrade primer-coin-game
```

Another way to install it is by manually cloning the repo and you should be able to run it. To clone you can use:

```

### Executing program

Try running the example simulator in a terminal, e.g using:
