Usage
===============


Known configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can use a known configuration from ``pyQSC`` to start tracing particles.
For example, if we wanted to use the second order configuration from
section 5.2 of [LandremanSengupta]_, we can simply run the script

.. code-block::

   ./main.py

in the ``src/neat`` folder.
