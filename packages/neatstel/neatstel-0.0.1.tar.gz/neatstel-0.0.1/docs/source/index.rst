NEAT Documentation
===================

NEAT is a python framework that is intended to find optimized stellarator configurations for fast particle confinement using the near-axis expansion formalism.
The magnetic field is calculated using the code [pyQSC](https://github.com/landreman/pyQSC/), the particle orbits are traced using the code [gyronimo](https://github.com/prodrigs/gyronimo) (included as a submodule) and the optimization is done using the code [simsopt](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/).

``pyQSC`` is fully open-source, and anyone is welcome to
make suggestions, contribute, and use.
