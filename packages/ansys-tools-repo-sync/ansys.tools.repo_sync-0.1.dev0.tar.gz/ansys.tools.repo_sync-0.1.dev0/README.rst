The ``ansys-tools-repo-sync`` library is intended to synchronize the content
of two different repositories.

What does this library do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For instance, due to intellectual properties concerns, it might not be possible
to expose publicly the entire content of a private repository.
Its owner could decide to have a second repository, a public one.
Part of the content for this public repo would come from the private repository.

``ansys-tools-repo-sync`` allows you to do so by copying a folder and its content
from one repo to the other.
In addition, it is possible to filter the type extension file authorized to be copied.

How to use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common usage for this tool consist to integrate it in one of your CI/CD pipeline or workflow.
Firstly, the tool must be installed.

.. code:: bash

    pip install ansys-tools-repo-sync


Then, it can be used in the considered workflow with the appropriate arguments.

Run it as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    python -c "from ansys.tools.repo_sync import synchronize"; synchronize(
    manifest=os.path.join(ASSETS_DIRECTORY, "manifest.txt"),
    token=TOKEN,
    repository="ansys-tools-repo-sync",
    organization="ansys",
    protos_path=os.path.join("assets", "ansys", "api", "test", "v0"),
    dry_run=True,
    )"

.. note::
    The parameter ``dry_run`` can be set to ``True`` while establishing
    the entire workflow for the first time. It helps preventing uncessary commits
    of sensitive data. It will print the content expected to be committed in the
    public repository.
